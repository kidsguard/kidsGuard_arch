 security architecture

***Children today are growing up in a highly developed technological environment. Like it or not, children are spending more and more time using, computers, laptops with unlimited internet access. We are looking at ways to incorporate the child's technology environment (PC/laptop) into our cyber security architecture. Main mission: to restrict children from disturbing content on the Internet, time tracking of games and programs, monitoring of correspondence, cyber defense, cyber hygiene, prevention and alerting - in-depth behavioral analysis for parents and guardians who can use this to get data on your child's Internet activity and take action to reduce risks.***
